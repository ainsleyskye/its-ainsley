            Ainsley made this site after only two weeks of learning how to code!
            It's a tic-tac-toe arcade inspired by the pixel-art games Ainsley
            grew up playing. Even after completing many other projects, this
            project remains the one Ainsley is most proud of. Tried playing
            against the computer player yet? You may find that winning isn't as
            easy as you might think!

          <span class="content">
            Working in a pair over the course of about a week and a half,
            Ainsley and their classmate Kendal made this site as a fake fitness
            routine tracker - everything from test-driven development of the
            back-end to bizarre project requirements for the front-end. Ainsley
            isn't sure why you would need to make a website, much less a
            social-media oriented site for your workout routines, but it is the
            internet, which means there's bound to be a market for it!

          <span class="content">
            When Ainsley was placed with Kendal, Joe, & Dom for their capstone
            project, the group was only told that the project must be a mock-up
            of an e-commerce site and given the basic project requirements.
            Luckily, everyone in our group is a huge fan of the Pokemon games!
            So we decided to answer a question: if the people in the Pokemon
            games have such advanced technology to capture wild beasts in tiny
            little PokeBalls, why do Pokemon trainers have to visit physical
            shops to buy items that they may need on their quests? Thus, the
            SafariZone Department Store was born, a one-stop-shop right at your
            fingertips for any and all items a Pokemon trainer may need!
